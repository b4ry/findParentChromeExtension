# User Guide üìö

An instruction on how to use the extension and on how to understand its communication.

## How to
The extension has a form of a popup which accepts a user's input.

The extension looks for a fist parent element (with a non-static position) to the element specified with the **element's selector**.

### üìå Element's selector input + Find button

The input accepts any CSS selector. It can be retrieved via the Chrome Dev tools:

After copying the selector, simply paste it in the input and click **Find**.</br>
There can be many different results depending on the provided selector, as following.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ No element associated with the selector

If there is no element associated with the provided selector, the extension will alert saying it could not find an element.</br>
The message will also include the selector used (_test_ in the example below).

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ A direct parent found

If there is a direct parent found, then this parent element is being highlighted with a flashy colour in addition to giving it a CSS class to make it easier to identify in case if the colours cannot be read for any reason.

### üìå Clear button

Clicking the **Clear** button removes the extension CSS class from the direct parent element, hence it has effect only if such a parent element was found - otherwise, it has no effect.
